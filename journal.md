# Sunday February 23rd - Saturday March 1st

Meet with Nicolas to discuss Arctic Ice and Forest Cover Projects. 
- Forest cover project appealed to him the most.
- Specifically the by-law compliance tree cover project seemed the most promising.
    - A tool / model that small towns could use would really improve enforcement of such by-laws. 
- We are not 100% satisfied with this idea. But we are going to write an abstract for it and go from there. 
- Another idea that has come into play is reinforcement learning for the best "tree planting policy". This idea has not been well formed yet.

# Sunday February 6th - Saturday February 22nd
David investigated data sources and project topics for arctic sea ice.
- High level ideas: 
    1. Causal link between Arctic Ice melting and sea level rise
    2. Predict regions of ice most likely to melt
    3. Forecast annual extent and concentration of sea ice 

Nicky investigated data sources and topics for forest/tree cover related projects
- High level ideas: 
    1. Monitor the change in forest cover in areas where companies have received carbon credits for planting trees (validating carbon credits)
    2. Making sure developers plant enough trees on their properties (validating by-law compliance).
    3. Detecting ideal locations to plant trees to stop deforestation (take into account the road network / how accessible a planting location is). 



# Sunday February 9th - Saturday February 15th
Formed group and started to brainstorm topics. The two ideas that stood out to us were Arctic Ice and Forest Cover related projects.
